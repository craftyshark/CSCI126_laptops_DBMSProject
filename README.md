# CSCI126_laptops_DBMSProject

Hi! is a small readme for the CSCI 126 DBSM project. 

Basic Instructions: 

Please take a look at the Read_me_and_run.sql file. It also has similar instructions there in case you didn't want to read through this, 
or in case someone skips over this read me. 

In order to set up the database, follow these steps: 

Step 1: Run the first three create table queries in a new database. Do not yet run anything past the second comment in the file. 

Step 2: Import the correct data into the correct tables. 

  CSV File->Table
  
  Cpus_used.csv -> Cpus_used
  
  laptop_model_skews.csv -> laptop_model_skews
  
  manufacturers.csv -> manufacturers
  
 Step 3: Almost done, now simply Run the alter table and next three update queries. 
  This will add a new column to our Cpus_used table, which will let us analyse different market share, and other intresting aspect of 
  The use of different CPU OEMs

All done. 

The rest of the file simply contains different quries that can be run. As well as an insertion and update query that will change the database, so keep that in mind 
when running those.
